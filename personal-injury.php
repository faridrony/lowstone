								<p>First consultation is always free of  charge for personal  injury questions. If the case is taken there is a contingency fee, no recovery no fee or costs will be paid by you to my office (you may have to pay the other sides costs of litigation if  you lose, and may have to pay damages for frivolous and malicious lawsuits).</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Have you been in an accident?</li>
									<li>Have you been injured?</li>
									<li>Are you in pain and do you suffer?</li>
								</ul>

								<p>If someone or some corporation has injured you, don’t suffer the pain of that injury without attempting to get compensation. Talk to a lawyer who knows the law and can help you determine if you are entitled under current law to be compensated for:</p> 

								<ul>
									<li>Loss of enjoyment of life</li>
									<li>Pain and suffering past medical bills</li>
									<li>Future medical bills</li>
									<li>Damage to automobiles or other property</li>
									<li>Loss of consortium</li>
									<li>(care comfort society and affection)</li>
								</ul>

								<p>Even if you have been injured before or have pre-existing conditions you may be entitled to recover benefits.</p>
								<p>Only a qualified attorney can tell you what insurance or other benefits are available to you.</p>
								<p>Do you understand California’s Proposition 213 which forbids the payment of pain and suffering if you have no insurance?</p>

								<p>Do you know all the exceptions that allow you to collect anyway.</p>
								<p>Do you understand how to find and obtain medical treatment for your injuries.</p>
								<p>Have you been injured by a public entity? Do you know what absolute deadlines apply?</p>
								<p>Do you have access to all of the latest legal and medical research online?</p>
								<p>If you don’t you need an attorney who does.</p>
